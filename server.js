// Packages used for this project are stored in variables below
const inquirer = require('inquirer')

const { Pool } = require('pg');
// https://node-postgres.com/features/pooling
// Use inquirer to capture user prompts to interact with Postgres database like the README generator

// Create a connection to the postgres database. Review examples from activities to create a connection string

// Application logic

// Prompt the user asking them what they want to do using inquirer
// Examples:
// View department function and rinse and repeat for all of the tables
// Since department is the most simple create the schema, seeds, and the function for the departments. Then try with roles and lastly to the employees
